# mission-to-mars

This challenge was to accuire data from several websites using web scrapping by employing BeatuifulSoup, spinter, and Pandas coding.

## Results
The webscrapping was successful and the news, tables, images of the mar hemispheres were obtained.
I was not sucessful at using flask to connect to the databas so the data was not saved successfully.
